- 👋 Hi, I’m @Azura974
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C and Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything but I may not have the time
- 📫 How to reach me: Try using my email : [azurathedragonoffi@gmail.com]

I'm a "Computer engineering" student currently but I'm more of a programmer than anything else. Oh and an artist (search on Instagram for @azurafr.draws for that part). And I'm French.  
My brain sometimes just do "random bullshit go" sometimes so this is the reason why I have GitHub. GitHub and shit on it. I swear I'll make a good use of this someday ! Or at least I hope.  
Dammit.
